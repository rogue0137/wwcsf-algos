## Resources

### 1. Linked List Basics
* [Notes on linked lists and an example class in Python](https://github.com/rogue0137/practice/blob/master/data_structure_info/linked_lists/linked_lists.md), by mentor [Krys Flores](https://www.krysflores.com)
* [Chapter 2. Selection Sort](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-2/) from _Grokking Algorithms_ by Aditya Bhargava
* [Introduction to Linked Lists](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WwfhLC16bis) by CS Dojo with examples in JavaScript and Python.
* [Harvard CS50 2019 Data Structures Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IrUAqYKjIA&list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW&index=6&t=1823s)
Code examples are in C, but the lecturer’s explanations and demos do not rely on an understanding of C. 

### 2. Language-Specific Resources
* Java: [Linked Lists](http://greenteapress.com/thinkdast/html/thinkdast005.html) from _Think Data Structures_ in Java, by Allen B. Downey
* C/C++: [Linked List Basics](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/LinkedListBasics.pdf) by the Stanford CS department.  
This article is helpful even if you don’t know C. Recommended for coders who understand how a linked list behaves, and want to get a solid understanding of how the implementation is done with pointers and memory. 
* [Implementing an Unordered List](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/BasicDS/ImplementinganUnorderedListLinkedLists.html) from _Python DS_

### 3. Two Pointer Technique (also called inch-worming):
Once you wrap your head around what a linked list is, you will probably try to implement insert or delete and then lose a link pointer somewhere along the way to the rest of your list. 
Don’t let it happen to you!  
* [Article on the Two Pointer Technique](https://leetcode.com/articles/two-pointer-technique/#), by leetcode.  
* [Deleting a node in a linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-3-deleting-node/), by geeksforgeeks. Demonstrates two-pointer technique with code examples in C/C++, Java, and Python 3. 

### 4. Code Examples
* Here is a [basic Linked List class](https://github.com/elaguerta/wwcsf-algos/blob/master/code-examples/LinkedLists/LinkedList.py) with iterative methods. Look at LinkedList.remove() for an example of two-pointer technique. 

* Here is a [Linked List Class](https://github.com/elaguerta/wwcsf-algos/blob/master/code-examples/LinkedLists/LinkedListRecursive.py) with some recursive methods
