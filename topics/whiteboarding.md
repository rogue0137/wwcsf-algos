# Whiteboarding Tips

For virtual interviews, consider keeping a printed copy of these tips near your desk.
For in-person interviews, commit these to memory!
Thanks to [Krys Flores](https://www.krysflores.com) for many of these tips!

1. Repeat the problem back to the interviewer using example input and output to make sure you understand the question
2. State your approach in broad terms. As you do so, write out pseudo-code, function stubs, or other big landmarks in your program
3. State (and write down) your assumptions
4. Use good variable names
5. Solve messy, refactor if you have time
6. Walk your interviewer through the problem using your output
7. Trace your program like a debugger, writing down the values of intermediate variables as you go. Practice this on a whiteboard and on a text editor.
8. Give [O(n)](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/wwcsf-algos/tree/master/topics/big-O.md) time and space complexity
