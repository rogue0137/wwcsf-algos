## 2. General Study Resources
These are a list of free online textbooks, video lectures, and visualizations. If you are looking for comprehensive, structured curriculums to guide your study, these are places to start.

### 2a. Free Online Textbooks
1. [Grokking Algorithms, Aditya Y. Bhargava](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/about-this-book/): A guide to a few carefully curated algorithms, with helpful drawings. Code examples in Python.  
2. [Python DS, Brad Miller and David Ranum](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html): Data Structures textbook in Python. 
3. [Open Data Structures, Pat Morin](https://opendatastructures.org/ods-python/): Data structures textbook in pseudocode.
4. [Think Data Structures, Allen B. Downey](http://greenteapress.com/thinkdast/thinkdast.pdf): Data structures textbook in Java.
5. [Think Python, Allen B. Downey](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html): Intro programming textbook in Python, with chapters relevant to algorithms and data structures. 


### 2b. Video Lectures  
1. [Harvard CS50 Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW).
    * Recommended: [Lecture 3 - Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykrlqbV9wM&list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW&t=0s) and [Lecture 5 - Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IrUAqYKjIA&list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW&t=0s)
    
 ### 2c. Free Courses
 1. [Coursera, Data Structures by UCSD](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/home/welcome)
 2. [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en): The tag line for this resource is "visualizing data structures and algorithms through animation". This is an incredible resource for any level of coder. Animations step through processes, and the explanations link to related topics, helping you synthesize your knowledge and build on previous undertstanding. The text is small and dense but it is well worth reading. Make sure to create an account to tailer your preferences and create a training plan.
 
 ### 2d. Articles
 1. [Wikiversity Data Structures and Algorithms](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms): Provides an overview of the Data Structure and Algorithms conceptual landscape. Recommended for its definitions of technical terms.
